## üìÅ How It Works

1. **Browser Launch**: Bot opens a Puppeteer browser instance
2. **Meeting Join**: Navigates to the meeting URL and joins with the specified name
3. **Media Setup**: Disables bot's microphone and camera
4. **Recording Start**: Begins FFmpeg screen recording with audio capture
5. **Monitoring**: Checks participant count every 5 seconds
6. **Auto Stop**: When ‚â§2 participants remain, stops recording
7. **Upload**: Automatically uploads the recording to AWS S3
8. **Cleanup**: Closes browser and cleans up resources

---

## üóÇ Recording Details

- **Format**: MP4 with H.264 video and AAC audio
- **Resolution**: 1280x720 at 20fps
- **Audio**: Captured via PulseAudio null sink
- **Location**: `/app/recordings/BotName-timestamp.mp4`
- **Upload**: Automatic upload to configured S3 bucket

---

## üê≥ Docker Environment

The bot is designed to run in a containerized environment with:
- Virtual display (`:99`) via Xvfb
- PulseAudio for audio capture
- All dependencies pre-installed

---

## üìù Notes

- Bot considers a meeting "ended" when participant count drops to 2 or fewer
- Recording starts immediately after joining the meeting
- Failed uploads will cause the bot to exit with an error
- All resources are properly cleaned up on exit or error
